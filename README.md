Alternative to `cargo fetch` for use in CI or other "clean" environments that you want to quickly bootstrap
with the necessary crates to compile/test etc your project(s).

## Why?

* You run CI jobs inside of [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) and want faster crate.io and git downloads.

## Why not?

* You don't run CI inside of GCP. Currently `cargo-fetcher` only supports storing crates/git snapshots
inside of [GCS](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) which means they can be located closer to the compute resources your CI is running on. PRs are of course welcome for adding additional storage backends though!
* `cargo-fetcher` should not be used in a typical user environment as it completely disregards various
safety mechanisms that are built into cargo, such as file-based locking.
* You project doesn't have a Cargo.lock file. `cargo-fetcher` only works with Cargo.lock files, so if you have a 
library project that doesn't have a checked in Cargo.lock, `cargo-fetcher` is not for you.
